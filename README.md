# Tic Tac Toe
My first game is Tic Tac Toe. It's a two player game where each player takes a turn and marks a square on the board. The first player to mark three squares in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
This is my realisation of the game. For now there is no a draw in the game, you need to restar it manualy.
In the IgorTry branch, realisation maded by my friend.
